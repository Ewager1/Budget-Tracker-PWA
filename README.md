# Budget-Tracker-PWA

## Description

[Budget Tracker Demo](https://budget-tracker-e-wager.herokuapp.com/)

A budget tracker that utilizes service workers and indexxed DB to work offline. When the user goes offline,
a cached version of the site is rendered and indexxedDB holds any changes. When the user comes back online,
the data from indexxed DB updated to the database seemlessly.
